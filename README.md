# Prediction Rigidities for Data-Driven Chemistry

This repository contains the scripts that were used to obtain the results shared in [our contribution](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fd/d4fd00101j) to the Faraday Discussions: "Data-driven discovery in the chemical sciences".

The files are organized into the following directories:

## `section_3`: PRs of NN models

## `section_4a`: PR-guided dataset construction -- dataset augmentation

## `section_4b`: PR-guided dataset construction -- active learning

## `section_5a`: Component-wise prediction rigidity -- body-ordered model

## `section_5b`: Component-wise prediction rigidity -- multi-range model

## `section_6`: Application to coarse-grained water model
